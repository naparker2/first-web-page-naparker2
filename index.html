      <h2>The Origins</h2>
      <p>There are three common peacock species, the blue peacock (Pavo cristatus), the green peacock, and the African
        peafowl. The blue peacock, also known as the Indian peacock is the most common type of peacock kept as a pet.
        They are native to India and Sri Lanka. The green peacock is native to Java and Myanmar while the African
        peacock also called the Congo peacock is found in sub-Saharan Africa. Peafowl is a collective term used for
        peacocks.</p>

    <aside>
      <p>Peacocks are large, colorful pheasants (typically blue and green) known for their iridescent tails. These tail
        feathers, or coverts, spread out in a distinctive train that is more than 60% of the bird’s total body length
        and boast colorful “eye” markings of blue, gold, red, and other hues.</p>
